# Guess the Number! 🤔

## The goal is to find out what the number is under the question mark??

I have built this little game 🎮 which you can clone down to your own computer 💻
`git clone https://github.com/szabinakov/Guess-My-Number.git`
navigate into the folder
`cd Guess-My-Number`
and then with
`open index.html`
you are able to play the game in your browser!
