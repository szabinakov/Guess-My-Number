# Guess the Number! 🤔

## The goal is to find out what the number is under the question mark??

I have built this little game 🎮 which you can clone down to your own computer 💻 <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/szabinakov/Guess-My-Number.git` <br/>
navigate into the folder <br/>
`cd Guess-My-Number` <br/>
and then with <br/>
`open index.html` <br/>
you are able to play the game in your browser! <br/>
